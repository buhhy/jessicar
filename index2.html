						<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
						<p>Inkling, one of Fast Company&#700;s Most Innovative Companies of 2014, a comprehensive list of interactive books available in its library. Although many of the visitors to the library are readers, an increasing number of them arepublishing professionals.</p>
						<p>From September to December 2013, I worked closely with the Inkling&#700;s Product Design team as a User Experience Design Intern. As the designer for the Library Pagination project, Ibrought it from ground zero towards implementation</p> 
					</article>
					<article class="blurb">
						<h3>PROBLEMS</h3>
						<p>Publishing professionals are very involved in several projects, easily accumulating thousands of titles under their wing. However, these people have to wait up to three minutes to load the page before they can start working. Aside from long loading times, our users have addressed their difficulty in finding books. </p>
						<p>In short, Inkling is experiencing growing pains: slow loading times & difficulty in finding books. The new design needs to accommodate the rapid growth of users.</p>
					</article>
					<article class="blurb">
						<h3>PROCESS</h3>
						<h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
						<p>I was introduced to a project involving pagination by my manager. He briefly explained that Inkling was foreseeing growing pains in the library, and then connected me with an expert on the matter. I was able to book a meeting with himin three days; in the meantime, I accustomed myself with the library.</p>
						<h5>INTERVIEWING</h5>
						<p>Prior to meeting, I created a list of questions that could help me understand the problem they were already beginning to experience with the increasing number of users and books. He provided me with a clear and thorough explanation of the problem, and was able to direct me to other people for more information if I needed it.</p>
						<h5>IDEA GENERATION</h5>
						<p>After understanding the problem, I connected and sometimes collaborated) with developers and designers to work through some ideas. At Inkling, everyone was very supportive, knowledgeable, andresponsive; we worked together to come up with questions and ideas that we wouldnâ€™t have come upwith on our own.</p>
						<h5>WIREFRAMES</h5>
						<p>At this time, so many iterations were beingmade to wireframes. This was an important time forthe project because it helps us focus on functionality and solving the problem (instead ofmaking pretty things). Throughout this process, I connected with the expert to ask questions and forhis opinions on the final wireframe rounds. My manager believed in collaborating with other designers as much as possible; we worked together through the wireframes.</p>
						<h5>MOCKUPS</h5>
						<p>After running through the wireframes, it was time to take a few of them and mock them in high fidelity. In this stage, there are still many more iterations.</p>
						<p>As I got closer to the final iterations, I also ran my mockups through other people not in my team (i.e., publishing managers and support). As mockups became more concrete, there was sometimes a little disagreement concerning design choices between different parties. I approached this obstacle by speaking to these parties, understanding their perspective at a fundamental level, and by making the final decision after considering all of the needs and goals.</p>
