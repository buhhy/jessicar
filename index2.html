						<p>From September to December 2013, I worked closely with the Inkling&#700;s Product Design team as a User Experience Design Intern. I designed <b>a new library to optimize for scalability</b>.</p>

						<span class="image-desc">An Inkling Design Meeting</span>

					</article>
					<article class="blurb">
						<h3>Problems</h3>
						<p>Publishing professionals are very involved in several projects, easily accumulating thousands of titles under their wing. After conducting several rounds of interviews, I discovered that many of the may have to wait over a minute to load the page before they can start working. Aside from long loading times, our users have addressed their difficulty in finding books.</p>

						<img src="img/libpag-original.png" alt="Original Inkling Library">
						<span class="image-desc">Some users had to wait over a minute to load hundreds of books, 
						<br />then scroll through the list to find a particular book.</span>

						<p>In short, Inkling was experiencing growing pains: <b>slow loading times & difficulty in finding books</b>. The new design needs to accommodate the rapid growth of users.</p>
					</article>

					<article class="blurb">
						<h3>Method</h3>
						<h6>HYPOTHESES</h6>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Pagination will significantly reduce loading times in the library.</b>
							<br />Long loading times are costly to the user and to the entire company if people need to wait before they begin work. The solution is to introduce pagination to the library, so that not all of the books are loaded at once.</li>
							<li><b>Smarter sorting and search allows users to find books faster.</b>
							<br />Users know that scrolling through hundred books to find a specific book is a very inefficient way to use their time. Instead, they use the browser&#700;s &ldquo;Find on page&rdquo; (ctrl+F or cmd+F) to find their book after the page has been loaded. 
							</li>
						</ol>

					<article class="blurb">
						<h3>Solution</h3>
						<h6>FINAL MOCKUP</h6>
						<p>After approximately 5 mockup iterations, I received approval from the project manager and other designers. However, I also consulted a designer who was leading Inkling&#700;s web identity to ensure that the style is compliant with Inkling&#700;s.</p>
						<p>The solution identifies two users under Inkling: the regular users and the publishing professionals&#151;often referred to as Habitat users.

						<span class="image-desc">Please click the image above to see the full mockup spec.</span>

						<h6>FUTURE DIRECTION</h6>
						<p>I worked on this project for approximately 2 months. Since it was a 4-month internship and Inkling&#700;s roadmap was full at the time, I found out that I wouldn&#700;t be able to see this project through implementation. I wrapped up this project by writing up a design and technical spec document consisting of the rationale behind my design choices, in case there were any questions while I was gone.</p>

						<h6>REFLECTION</h6>
						<p>This project has made a significant impact to me in many ways. Working in a highly collaborative learning environment can be uncomfortable at times, but also the BEST thing I could do to grow professionally and personally. I was motivated by the ambition and openness that everyone, not only the designers, had towards design.</p>
						<p>This project provided me with the opportunity to independently work through a design problem and presented it to a group of amazing designers.</p>
						<p>My favorite quote: &ldquo;How do you know it won&#700;t work? Just mock it up&#151;it&#700;ll take how long? Two minutes?&rdquo; &#150; my former manager, Chatree Campiranon</p>

						<p>From September to December 2013, I worked closely with the Inkling&#700;s Product Design team as a User Experience Design Intern. I worked on a project to <b>increase app downloads by educating people about Inkling&#700;s reader app</b>.</p>

						<img src="img/appdl-devicelockup.png" alt="Inkling devices">
						<span class="image-desc">Users can read their Inkling books on their computer, tablet, or mobile phone.</span>

					</article>
					<article class="blurb">
						<h3>Problems</h3>
						<p>When people are viewing an Inkling book through their web browser on their desktop, phone, or tablet, the users should also know that Inkling supports native mobile apps to enhance their reading experience. Inkling was investigating ways to educate their users about the mobile app without being too intrusive.</p>

						<a class="image-link" href="img/appdl-orig.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/appdl-orig.png" alt="Inkling Original Prompt">
						<span class="image-desc">An Inkling prompt placed at the end of the reading material.</span></a>

						<p>Inkling was researching the placement of prompts that educate users about the app. They have discovered that presenting the app too early will increase the bounce rate (i.e., before reading material), but presenting the app too late (i.e., at the end of the reading material) decreases the user&#700;s exposure to the call-to-action.</p>
					</article>

					<article class="blurb">
						<h3>Method</h3>
						<h6>HYPOTHESES</h6>
						<p><b>Placing a prompt within reading material will yield a greater number of visits to the app download page.</b>
						<br />Educating the user about the Inkling app after they have read some of the content will increase the number of visits to the app download page. This approach combines the benefit of presenting the app early (i.e., the user will definitely see it), and the benefit of presenting the app late (i.e., it the reader is likely interested and enjoying the reading material).</p>

						<h6>PROCESS</h6>
						<p>Idea Generation, Wireframes, Mockups, Graphic Design, Presentation</p>

						<h6>IDEAS</h6>
						<a class="image-link" href="img/appdl-ideas.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/appdl-ideas.png" alt="App Downloads Ideas"></a>

						<a class="image-link" href="img/appdl-copy.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/appdl-copy.png" alt="App Downloads Testing Copy"></a>
						<span class="image-desc">I created different messages, experimenting with the copy.</span>

						<h6>TESTING</h6>
						<p>The project manager of the Growth Team indicated that there were many challenges with inserting prompts into reader cards because the content can be at variable length. I tested this concept on ten different pieces of content with varying material by creating high fidelity mockups.</p>
						<a class="image-link" href="img/appdl-testing.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/appdl-testing.png" alt="App Downloads Testing"></a>
						<p>However, the project manager brought up an interesting limitation of the concept. If users continued to read past the prompt, they may have trouble navigating back to the place where they had seen the prompt. Even worse, they might even forget about the prompt. Her question gave me the idea of implementing a sticky header; when the prompt is about to move beyond the top of the screen, a small prompt takes form that acts as a quick way for the user to visit the app download page.</p>

					</article>

					<article class="blurb">
						<h3>Solution</h3>
						<h6>FINAL MOCKUP</h6>
						<p>After numerous tests, I received approval from the project manager and was used in Inkling&#700;s multivariate research design along with three other concepts.</p> 

						<a class="image-link" href="img/appdl-final.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/appdl-final.png" alt="App Downloads Testing"></a>
						<span class="image-desc">Please click the image above to see the full mockup spec.</span>

						<h6>REFLECTION</h6>
						<p>My experience with the Growth team at Inkling was the first time I got to see design so integrated with analysis, testing, and speculation. The Growth team is also very transparent; the entire company can learn from their findings that were obtained from design testing and analysis.</p>
						<p>Most of all, I felt that the Growth team had the perfect balance of pressure and support. We moved quickly and questioned everything in our design choices, leaving our personal baggage behind.</p>
						<p>My favorite quote: &ldquo;I don&#700;t think we should go ahead with this design.&rdquo; &#150; Emily Short, Project Manager of Inkling’s Growth Team (said this after a whole month of work, and was basically a push for me to explain the design)</p>

						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>At the beginning of every study term, undergraduate students review their course schedules. Course schedules can vary from student to student, so there is a lot of sharing on Facebook at this time. Ever since first year, this has been an ongoing trend where students would take screenshots of their schedule and share it with other friends to see who is also taking similar courses. There are also students that like to print their schedules out to put on the door of their dorm room or shared fridge.</p>

						<img src="img/pinecone-quest.png" alt="Typical Student schedule">
						<span class="image-desc">An example of a typical student schedule.</span>

						<p>In my last term at the University of Waterloo, I designed <b><a href="pinecone.terencelei.com/" target="_blank">Pinecone</a></b>, a web-based design tool that is easy for University of Waterloo students to customize their class schedules. They can also print and share their schedules on Facebook from the browser.</p>

					</article>
					<article class="blurb">
						<h3>Problem</h3>
						<p>The automatically generated course schedules provided by the student portal look incredibly plain. A few of my friends went through the trouble of actually redesigning the course schedule with paper and pencil crayon, or using Microsoft Excel. We often wanted to share our schedules in on and offline with our peers, but it quickly became a chore.</p>

						<img src="img/pinecone-fridge.png" alt="Design Team">
						<span class="image-desc">An old picture of my friend posing by our fridge from the dorming days.</span>

						<p>A few students, like myself, wanted <b>an easy way to create and share our schedules in a unique and clean calendar</b>.</p>
					</article>

					<article class="blurb">
						<h3>Solution</h3>
						<h6>PROCESS</h6>
						<p>For this project, I worked on the design and front-end web development. Software Engineering graduate Terence Lei worked on the back-end web development.</p>

						<h6>RESULT</h6>
						<p>I've included a screenshot below, but <b>feel free to <a href="pinecone.terencelei.com" target="_blank">try Pinecone out</a> and make yourself a schedule</b>!</p>
						<img src="img/pinecone-final.png" alt="Pinecone Final">

						<p>Pinecone is also great for course planning because the search not only takes course codes (e.g., CS 250), but you can also search keywords (e.g., game, artificial intelligence) and find relevant courses that are held in the term.</p>

						<h6>FUTURE DIRECTION</h6>
						<p>Not many students know about the course scheduler, especially because most of my friends have graduated at this point. Regardless of the lack of exposure, Pinecone updates the course list regularly. We will continue to support Pinecone.</p>

						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>The University of Waterloo Badminton Club (UWBC) hosts regular casual badminton sessions. Every 15 minutes during a session, players are rotated onto courts to play badminton. Players are assigned a level based on their playing skill and may have preferences for singles or doubles games, and players they want to play with. UWBC must ensure players get fair playing time while matching players with similar skill levels together and respecting each player's preferences.</p>

						<p>In January 2014, I designed the web platform for game matching for a Software Engineering Final Capstone Project which was implemented by four Software Engineering students from the University of Waterloo. In the spring of 2014, the project was displayed and presented at the University of Waterloo Engineering Symposium.</p>

						<img src="img/quickmatch-intro.svg" alt="Design Team">
						<span class="image-desc">An Inkling Design Meeting</span>

					</article>
					<article class="blurb">
						<h3>Problems</h3>
						<p>Game matching at the UWBC is currently done manually by the club executive members, which is highly prone to human error and bias. The execs have to move name tags on a physical board to indicate which players are playing and which will go next. With 84 players per session, it can be easy to mix up which players have already played. Furthermore, the executive member needs to consciously match players based on equal skill levels.</p>

						<p>Another problem with using a physical board is that at any given time, there are players crowding around the board to check if they are next. A possible problem is that players may knock off other nametags and place themselves on.</p>

						<p>In other words, the problems that UWBC face are <b>poor matchmaking & crowding around the screens</b>.</p>

						<h3>Method</h3>
						<h6>HYPOTHESES</h6>
						<ol>
							<li><b>A customized game-matching algorithm will ensure that all game matches are balanced and that all players will have equal opportunities to play.</b></li>
							<li><b>Replacing the physical board with a large screen with a clearer layout will reduce crowding and rigging of the matches.</b></li>
						</ol>

						<h6>PROCESS</h6>
						<p>Idea Generation, Wireframes, Mockups, Graphic Design, Presentation, Poster</p>

						<h3>Solution</h3>
						<h6>FINAL MOCKUP</h6>
						<p>In the solution, there are two screens: one is the Admin screen which is viewed on the computer which the executive uses to set up matches, and the Public screen is a viewed on a large monitor that can be viewed by players at a distance.</p>

						<p>Quickmatch had been used by the UWBC several times for testing. Overall, it received favourable feedback from the club and the players.</p>

						<p><b>Quickmatch helps organize casual matches based on the following criteria:</b>
						<ol>
							<li>players are around the same skill level</li>
							<li>players get their fair share of playing time</li>
							<li>player preferences are respected, singles or doubles</li>
							<li>fresh match-ups instead of matching the same players every match</li>
						</ol></p>

						<h6>FUTURE DIRECTION</h6>
						<p>The project concluded a while after the University of Waterloo Engineering Symposium and the members graduated from their programs. They are beginning work at various tech companies, and will not have time to continue this project. If we continued working on this project, I would like to collect more user feedback. We were also entertaining the possibility of making a club management system to help clubs keep track of their members and other meaningful information (program of study, student numbers, etc.) We also thought it would be great to make an app where players could get notifications when they were set to play in the next round of matches. We had many ideas, but not enough time to implement all of our ideas.</p>

						<h6>REFLECTION</h6>
						<p>Although I was not formally part of the team (as I am not in their program), I found myself very invested in solving the problem. One main problem that we didn&#700;t discuss very deeply was the business model to get this project to become more than just a fourth year design project. A few members were interested in continuing development for this project, but could not afford to work on it for free. Although they had some confidence that Quickmatch could become profitable down the road, it might take an exorbitant amount of time and energy to work with the school.</p>
