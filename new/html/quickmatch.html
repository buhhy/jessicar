          In January 2014, I designed the web platform for game matching for a
          Software Engineering Final Capstone Project which was implemented by
          four Software Engineering students from the University of Waterloo. In
          the spring of 2014, the project was displayed and presented at the
          University of Waterloo Engineering Symposium.

            I began with talking to the UWBC President, a couple of executive
            leaders, and some of the regular members of UWBC to understand each
            of their pain points. I learned that every 15 minutes, players are
            rotated onto courts to play badminton. Players are assigned a level
            based on their playing skill and may have preferences for singles or
            doubles games, and players they want to play with. UWBC must ensure
            that players get fair playing time while matching similar skill
            levels together and respecting individual preferences.

          <h3 class="red">Matchmaking Errors</h3>
          <p>
            Game matching at UWBC was performed manually by the club executive
            members, which was highly prone to human error and bias. The execs
            had to move nametags on a physical board to indicate which players
            were playing and who were going next. With up to 84 players per
            session, it was easy to mix up which players had already played
            with those who hadn't. Furthermore, the executive member also 
            needed to consider skill levels when setting up matches.

          <h3 class="red">Crowding Around Boards</h3>
          <p>
            Another problem with using a physical board was that at any given
            time, there were people crowding around the board to check if they
            were going to play next. A possible problem was that players could
            knock off other nametags and place themselves on. It was a constant
            stressor for players.

              A customized game-matching algorithm will ensure that game
              matches are balanced and that all players will have equal
              opportunities to play.

              Replacing the physical board with a large digital screen monitor 
              and a clear layout will reduce crowding and rigging of the matches.

          I designed two screens: the Admin Screen is for the executive member
          to set up matches on a computer, and the Public Screen is designed for a larger
          screen monitor for club members to view at a distance.
          <h3>Admin Screen</h3>
          Executive members can perform match-making or changes to the system.

          In our final month before our final presentation, we built and tested 
          the matching system in partnership with UWBC. It received favourable 
          feedback from the club and the players. Finally, we presented the 
          project at the University of Waterloo Engineering Symposium in the
          spring of 2014.
