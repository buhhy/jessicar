        <h1>Paginated Library</h1>
        <h2>
          Inkling offers a comprehensive list of interactive books accessible 
          through its library. Although many of the visitors to the library 
          are readers, an increasing number of them are publishing 
          professionals who can oversee hundreds or thousands of projects at 
          a time.

          <p>I worked on Inkling's Product Design team as a User Experience Design 
          Intern from September to December 2013. Although my responsibilities 
          included assisting product designers with their projects or to create 
          assets for them, I also led my own projects. One of these projects was 
          the paginated library. It all began with a brief meeting with my 
          manager, who said "I have a project for you. I don't know the details, 
          but you should find out more from George."</p>
          <p>I could barely prepare any questions for George beforehand. When we 
          met, I understood him as our product specialist, in that he knew our 
          users very well. He frequently talked to and worked with our users.</p>

      <section>
        <div class="full">
          From our conversation, I recorded the user feedback he has heard for 
          the library. I learned that our users would wait over a minute to load 
          the page, then use cmd+f to search the page for their project. The 
          library also sometimes had two versions with the same project names, but 
          were distinguishable by examining their URLs. I condensed these concerns 
          into two main problems:
        </div>
        <div class="half">
          <h3 class="red">Slow Loading Times</h3>
          <p>Many users who were publishing professionals had to wait over a minute 
          to load the page before they could start working.</p>
          <h3 class="red">Difficult to Find Projects</h3>
          <p>Publishing professionals who had hundreds, or even thousands, of 
          projects had great difficulty finding a particular project or version.</p>

      <section class="continued">
        <div class="half">
          There was another challenge to consider when designing the new library. 
          A good number of users who were publishing professionals also used 
          Inkling to read for leisure. The new design has to include the ability to 
          switch or toggle between work projects and personal reading.

        <div class="full">
          After wireframing ideas, I came up with two hypotheses to address the slow loading times and difficulty with finding projects:
        </div>
        <div class="halves-container">
          <div class="half">
            <h3 class="blue">Pagination</h3>
            <p>will significantly reduce loading times in the library. Long loading times are costly to the user and to the company if people need to wait before they begin work. The solution is to introduce pagination to the library, so that not all of the books are loaded at once.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="half">
            <img src="../svg/inkling-pagicon.svg" alt="balance">

        <div class="halves-container">
          <div class="half">
            <h3 class="blue">Smarter sorting and search</h3>
            <p>allows users to find books faster. Scrolling through hundreds of books to find a specific one is very inefficient. Users searched for their books with the browser's "Find on page" feature (ctrl+F or cmd+F) after the page loaded.</p>

          <p>After many iterations, the following design solution was approved by the project manager and sent for development.</p>
