        <h1>Paginated Library</h1>
        <h2>
          Inkling offers a comprehensive list of interactive books through a
          library interface. Although many of our users read for leisure, there
          was an increasing number of enterprise users who used Inkling to 
          collaborate and manage hundreds or thousands of publishing projects.

          <p>I worked on Inkling's Product Design team as a User Experience Design 
          Intern from September to December 2013. Although my responsibilities 
          included assisting product designers with their projects or to create 
          assets for them, I also led my own projects. One of these projects was 
          the paginated library. It all began with a brief meeting with my 
          manager, who said "I have a project for you. I don't know the details, 
          but you should find out more from George."</p>

          <p>I learned that George was our Product Specialist; he knew our users well 
          because he worked very closely with them. George described the issues that 
          our users were experiencing at length, and explained the typical workflow 
          of our users to me. For example, they waited over a minute for the page to 
          load, then used cmd+f to search for their project. Also, they were confused 
          by how the library would show two versions of a project with the same name, 
          and that they were only were distinguishable by examining their URLs. I 
          condensed these concerns into two main problems:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="half">
          <h3 class="red">Slow Loading Times</h3>
          <p>Enterprise users with hundreds or thousands of projects and books had to 
          wait over a minute for the page to load before they could start reading or 
          working.</p>
          <h3 class="red">Difficult to Find Projects</h3>
          <p>Users relied on browser searching (cmd+f) to find a particular 
          book. They were also confused by seeing multiple projects with the same name,
          that could only be distinguished as different versions when the URL is examined.</p>

          Whle redesigning the new library, I had to also consider the fact that a good number
          of enterprise users would use Inkling for both work and leisure. The new design had 
          to have the ability to switch between work projects and personal reading.

          After wireframing different ideas, I came up with two hypotheses to address the 
          slow loading times and difficulty with finding projects:

        <div class="halves-container icon">
          <div class="half">
            <h3 class="blue">Pagination</h3>
            <p>Dividing the results into separate pages will significantly reduce loading 
            times in the library. People would not have to wait to start working or reading 
            because not all of books and projects will loaded at once.</p>

            <h3 class="blue">Smarter sorting and search</h3>
            <p>In order to help users find the right books faster, we want to show the most
            relevant projects and books first. We will also implement a search which will
            return all relevant books or projects.</p>

            <h4>Load More</h4>
            <p>Instead of loading all projects at once, the page will only load ten of the most relevant projects at a time. To sort by the most relevant projects, I looked at the API to see what kinds of sorting was available. I decided that we would sort by projects "Last Published", which means that most active projects will be ranked higher. Clicking the Load More button at the end of the page would load the next most relevant projects.</p>

            <h4>Organized Tabs</h4>
            <p>Publishing professionals use Inkling for both work (via our enterprise produce, Habitat) and for leisure. Therefore, these users can switch between the two tabs, Habitat Projects and their Personal Library. It was important to name the tabs clearly so that users could easily differentiate work projects from their personal reading.</p>

            <h4>Search</h4>
            <p>Adding a simple search engine that matches project titles can help users find any projects or books that were added earlier on. This is a fallback for professionals in the less frequent use case that they need to find something from a few months ago.</p>

            <h4>Tailored Interface</h4>
            <p>Although I was focused on solving the identified problems for publishing professionals, the regular users should not be left in the dark. Most of the changes that we were bringing to publishing professionals did not apply to our regular users. Therefore, I made few changes to the regular library.</p>

            <p>Regular users would also benefit from searching their libraries. Most regular 
            leisure readers did not have more than ten books, but rolling search out to them 
            would provide an opportunity to recommend unpurchased, but relevant, books.</p>
