        <h2>
          Inkling offers a comprehensive list of interactive books accessible 
          through its library. Although many of the visitors to the library 
          are readers, an increasing number of them are publishing 
          professionals who can oversee hundreds or thousands of projects at 
          a time.

          <p>I worked on Inkling's Product Design team as a User Experience Design 
          Intern from September to December 2013. Although my responsibilities 
          included assisting product designers with their projects or to create 
          assets for them, I also led my own projects. One of these projects was 
          the paginated library. It all began with a brief meeting with my 
          manager, who said "I have a project for you. I don't know the details, 
          but you should find out more from George."</p>
          <p>I could barely prepare any questions for George beforehand. When we 
          met, I understood him as our product specialist, in that he knew our 
          users very well. He frequently talked to and worked with our users.</p>

          From our conversation, I recorded the user feedback he has heard for 
          the library. I learned that our users would wait over a minute to load 
          the page, then use cmd+f to search the page for their project. The 
          library also sometimes had two versions with the same project names, but 
          were distinguishable by examining their URLs. I condensed these concerns 
          into two main problems:

        <div class="half">
          <h3 class="red">Slow Loading Times</h3>
          <p>Many users who were publishing professionals had to wait over a minute 
          to load the page before they could start working.</p>
          <h3 class="red">Difficult to Find Projects</h3>
          <p>Publishing professionals who had hundreds, or even thousands, of 
          projects had great difficulty finding a particular project or version.</p>

            There was another challenge to consider when designing the new library. 
            A good number of users who were publishing professionals also used 
            Inkling to read for leisure. The new design has to include the ability to 
            switch or toggle between work projects and personal reading.

              The new experience should present itself as a carefully crafted 
              and transparent product (e.g., beautifully show the value).

              The new experience should reduce cognitive load to help the user 
              get past it quickly and easily (e.g., presenting fewer options, 
              simple words).

          Our qualitative goals had to be measured using metrics and user
          feedback. I worked with the project manager to determine which metrics
          to use as a proxy for measuring success. We anticipated a big gain in
          brand, which is often an improvement that usually takes time to take
          effect.
