        <h1>New User Experience</h1>
        <h2>
          As of March 2016, Quora had 100 million monthly unique visitors to the
          website. With this amount of growth, it is important for the company
          to convert more visitors into happy, retained users.

          Since I joined Quora, I was drawn to improving the New User Experience
          (NUX). I started with running many small experiments to understand the
          space. Eventually, I fully assumed the responsibility to improve NUX.
          I felt that the design quality was not on par with the rest of the
          product, and was not receiving as much attention as it deserves.

          When users sign up, they want to read great content right away. Some
          users felt that Quora was putting unnecessary work between them and
          the content. However at this point in time, Quora needed to get
          explicit signal on what users liked to read. Therefore, we had to keep
          the step.

          I explored the problem further by conducting research via user
          interviews, workships, and brainstorms. Although we had to keep the
          step, it did not mean that they had to be as painful as they were to
          our users. The research boiled down to two main problems.

          Our qualitative goals had to be measured using metrics and user
          feedback. I worked with the project manager to determine which metrics
          to use as a proxy for measuring success. We anticipated a big gain in
          brand, which is often an improvement that usually takes time to take
          effect.
