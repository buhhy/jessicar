          Quora had 100 million monthly unique visitors as of March 2016, up from 
          80 million at the end of 2015.  With this amount of growth, it is 
          important for the company to convert more visitors into happy, retained 
          users.

          At Quora, I was able to work on many parts of the product. I was drawn 
          to improving the New User Experience (NUX) in particular, because it was 
          often the target of user criticism. Given its importance, I felt it was 
          not receiving as much attention as it deserved. I started with running 
          many small experiments to understand the space as best I could. 
          Eventually, I fully assumed the responsibility of improving NUX.
        </div>
        <h3>The Old NUX</h3>
        <div class="full condensed">
          After a new user signs up using their social media account or email 
          address, they have to complete a few more steps before they can read 
          content on Quora.
        </div>
        <div class="window-container">
          <h4>Follow Topics</h4>
          <img src="../img/quora-nux/nux-followtopics.png" alt="balance">
        </div>
        <div class="full condensed">
          In the first screen of our old NUX, we asked users to follow topics so we could 
          collect explicit signal on what the user likes to read. The options had no 
          significance and were arbitrarily selected a few years ago. As the user selects 
          a topic, new options are dynamically added to the very bottom of the list. The 
          user could only continue to the next step once they have followed at least 10 
          topics.
        </div>

        <div class="window-container">
          <h4>Add Knows About Topics</h4>
          <img src="../img/quora-nux/nux-knowsabout.png" alt="balance">
        </div>
        <div class="full condensed">
          The next step was important for collecting signal on the user's experiences and 
          areas of expertise. We needed to learn what kinds of questions we can route to 
          the user based off their self-reported expertise and, if they fill out their 
          topic biography, professional credentials.

      <section>
        <div class="half">
          When users sign up, they want to read great content right away. Some users 
          felt that Quora was putting unnecessary work between them and the content. 
          However at this point in time, Quora needed explicit signal to serve the 
          most relevant questions to the new users. Therefore, we learned that we 
          needed to keep the step, for now.

          I explored the problem further by conducting research via user interviews, 
          workshops, and brainstorms. Although we had to keep the step, it did not 
          mean that our NUX had to be as painful as it was for our users. The 
          research boiled down to two main problems.

          <div class="little-card">
            <h4 class="red">Problem 1</h4>
            <p>
              Users perceived the product as <b>untrustworthy</b> due to low
              design quality and product transparency.
            </p>

          <div class="little-card">
            <h4 class="red">Problem 2</h4>
            <p>
              Users did not understand why they were <b>forced</b> to do more work 
              to see content when they have already created their accounts.

              complete the signup process faster and with less effort (e.g., 
              presenting fewer options, simple words).

          Our qualitative goals had to be measured using metrics and user 
          feedback. I worked with the project manager to determine which metrics 
          to use as a proxy for measuring success. I designed a new concept to 
          achieve a more trustworthy and simple NUX. We anticipate a big gain in 
          brand, which is often an improvement that takes time to take effect.
