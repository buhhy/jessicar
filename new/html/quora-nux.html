          As of March 2016, Quora had 100 million monthly unique visitors to the
          product. With this amount of growth, it is important for the company
          to convert more visitors into happy, retained users.

          At Quora, I was able to touch on many parts of the product. I was 
          drawn to improving the New User Experience (NUX), especially due 
          to the user criticism. I felt it was not receiving as much attention
          as it deserved. I started with running many small experiments to 
          understand the space as best I could. Eventually, I fully assumed the 
          responsibility to improve NUX.

          When users sign up, they want to read great content right away. Some
          users felt that Quora was putting unnecessary work between them and
          the content. However at this point in time, Quora needed to get
          explicit signal on what users liked to read. Therefore, we learned 
          that we needed to keep the step, for now.

          I explored the problem further by conducting research via user
          interviews, workshops, and brainstorms. Although we had to keep the
          step, it did not mean that our NUX had to be as painful as it was 
          for our users. The research boiled down to two main problems.

              get past it quickly and easily (e.g., presenting fewer options,
              simple words).

          Our qualitative goals had to be measured using metrics and user
          feedback. I worked with the project manager to determine which metrics
          to use as a proxy for measuring success. We anticipate a big gain in
          brand, which is often an improvement that takes time to take effect.
