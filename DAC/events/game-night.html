			<h3>Description</h3>
			Come out and join us for a super fun night of board games! We go beyond monopoly and clue and play some really exciting, head-scratching games.

This event is a collaboration between the Glow Centre and the Food Bank to promote a more unified Waterloo community and to also fund-raise non-perishable foods for the Food Bank.

This event is open to all students and community members, and is a safe and inclusive space.
