			<h3>Description</h3>
			On Friday, March 21st, students from the Software Engineering Program at the University of Waterloo will present their design projects at the 5th Annual Capstone Design Project Symposium. 

More than 90 students will present 21 design project prototypes that solve problems in the general areas of software including brain simulation, mobile apps, cloud computing, entertainment, music, security, and artificial intelligence.

Students will exhibit innovative projects, such as using parallelization to improve the speed of Nengo brain simulation (http://nengo.ca/), adding integrity protection to the Linux kernel file systems, and a website for students to plan courses with friends (has already been used by many). 

The event will be held in the William G. Davis Computer Research Centre on the University of Waterloo campus, from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. 

Visitors are encouraged to browse the interactive displays and meet with students anytime during the symposium. Attendance is free.
