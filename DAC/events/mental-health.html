			<h3>Description</h3>
			Through the use of art, dance, writing and reflection this space aims to explore the state of mental health at our university and in the surrounding community. The organizers invite all students, faculty, and community members to visit this space in hopes that we can begin a conversation about mental health. By exploring what mental health is and what it means in the university community, we aim to challenge existing stigmas surrounding mental health. This space will explore what difficulties those with mental illness face, in daily life and when reaching out for help. This space symbolizes our &#147Small Act of Repair&#148, in which we hope to take steps towards a greater understanding of individual experiences with mental health, and promote awareness of the presence of mental health.

March 6 to March 22 in ML Gallery.

Open 9 am until 4:30 pm on weekdays.
